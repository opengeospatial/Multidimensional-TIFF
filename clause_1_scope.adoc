== Scope
The TIFF format can store many images in a single file.
It is possible to interpret those different images as different two-dimensional slices in a three-dimensional data cube.
The process can be extended to more than three dimensions.
This document defines new elements in the TIFF `GDAL_METADATA` tag for describing how the two-dimensional slices
are connected in a multi-dimensional data cube.
